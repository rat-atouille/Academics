## CS 2210 â€“ Data Structures and Algorithms
This course provides a foundational understanding of programming through the exploration of data structures and algorithms. Emphasizing the selection and design of appropriate data structures and algorithms for various problem domains, it aims to equip students with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.

Key topics covered include:
Design and analysis of algorithms
Time complexity analysis and asymptotic notation
Implementation of dictionaries and hash tables
Study of trees including binary search trees, AVL trees, multi-way search trees, (2,4)-trees, and B-trees
Graph theory, graph traversals, and algorithms
Various sorting algorithms
The course adopts an object-oriented approach, with implementations primarily in the Java programming language.

## CS 2211 - Software Tools and Systems Programming
This course offers an introduction to software tools and systems-level programming. It covers fundamental concepts such as program execution processes (compilation, linking, loading), an overview of UNIX operating systems, scripting languages, and C programming.

## CS 3305 -  Operating Systems
This course covers the basics of operating system design and implementation, including introductory concepts, process management, communication, scheduling, memory, and file systems.
