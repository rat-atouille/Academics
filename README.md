This repository consists of coding assignments from UWO CS courses.

## CS 2210 â€“ Data Structures and Algorithms
This course provides a foundational understanding of programming through the exploration of data structures and algorithms. Emphasizing the selection and design of appropriate data structures and algorithms for various problem domains, it aims to equip students with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.

## CS 2211 - Software Tools and Systems Programming
This course offers an introduction to software tools and systems-level programming. It covers fundamental concepts such as program execution processes (compilation, linking, loading), an overview of UNIX operating systems, scripting languages, and C programming.

## CS 3305 -  Operating Systems
This course covers the basics of operating system design and implementation, including introductory concepts, process management, communication, scheduling, memory, and file systems.

## CS 3319: DATABASE
This course introduces student to database management systems. The course discusses how to design a database for a real application. Design of good relational tables is followed by the use of these tables. The standard SQL data manipulation language will be used. Following the logical design phase, we discuss issues of physical storage structures and indexes. Finally, issues of backup and recovery, concurrency control and data distribution will be introduced.

## CS 4442: Artificial Intelligence
A broad range of areas falls into the field of Artificial Intelligence. In this course we give a brief introduction to two very active areas of Artificial Intelligence: machine learning and deep learning with applications in computer vision and/or natural language processing. The programming assignments will be done in Python/Matlab. During this course we will study both algorithmic perspectives of artificial intelligence and their practical applications.
